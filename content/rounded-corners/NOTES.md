# Notes

- Four rounded cornes: Properties palette > Shape > Rounded Corners
- If you want two rounded corners on one side (at the bottom in the example):
  - Create a rectangular shape of the right size.
  - Duplicate the shape (or copy paste: it has to stay at the same place).
  - Define the rounded corners on the duplicate.
  - Reduce the size of the original shape by draggin the handle on the middle of the opposite side.
  - Select both shapes
  - "Item > Path tools > Path operations" and choose the "Insersection" operation.
  - Convert the shape to the type of frame you need: "Item > Convert to... > ..."
- If you want only one rounded corner:
  - do the same as with two rounder corners but
  - shrink the original from the opposite corner as the one that should be rounded.
